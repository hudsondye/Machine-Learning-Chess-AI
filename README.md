Hi There! <br>

This is my first machine learning project focusing on creating a chess engine. <br>

If playing, I would recommend not using depth > 5 as it still takes a while.

Dependencies: <br>
chess (Python Chess Library) <br>
random <br>

Current Issues: <br>
Draw by repitition <br>
Promotion <br>
Opening & Piece Development <br>
